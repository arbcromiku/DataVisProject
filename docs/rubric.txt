Data Visualisation Project Design Book and Website (team)
Due 5 Dec by 23:59 Points 56 Submitting a file upload File types pdf and zip Available after 2 Sep at 0:00
Purpose
The purpose of this submission is to demonstrate that you and your team can develop an interactive data visualisation for the Data Visualisation Project that meets user needs.

The submission consists of two parts:

Design Book (evidence of data processing and your design process)
Website containing interactive data visualisation
Your Project must satisfy the brief provided in: Project Topic

This is a team deliverable worth 45% of your final mark.

Teams will be formed in Week 7 of the semester.

Students will be required to work on their own if they:

have NOT made an effort to be placed in a team before Week 9,
have NOT meaningfully communicated with their team before Week 9 Class, or
have NOT contributed to teamwork before Week 10 Stand-up.
Submission Requirements
File 1: Design Book

Format: Written Assignment (see template)

Word Limit:  None

Filetype: PDF

File 2: Data Processing

Format: KNWF (KNIME file - file name must include team name, file must include data)

Links

Item: Link to website hosted on Vercel with charts programmed in D3.

Item: Link to project GitHub site.

Links MUST be posted in comment section of submission.

Resubmission: Not permitted

Academic Integrity
See: Academic Integrity

IN ADDITION - You must submit work in progress for each Stand-up.

That is, you must:

submit expected milestones for Stand-Ups,
demonstrate understanding of work submitted for Stand-Up
Students who achieve two or more fail marks on the Project Stand-Ups may have their mark reduced relative to the achieved mark.

Lack of continuity between final Project and works submitted for stand-ups may result in an integrity investigation and/or a reduction in your Project mark relative to achieved mark.

Teamwork

Non-contribution to a team assessment is considered a matter of Academic Integrity.

Students who are rated poorly by their team mates, or are otherwise identified as not fully participating in the Project, may have their mark reduced relative to the achieved mark.
