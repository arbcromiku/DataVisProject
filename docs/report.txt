1 Introduction
1.1 Background and Motivation
•	The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) collects comprehensive data on road safety enforcement across Australia, including drug driving offenses detected through various testing methods. This dataset provides crucial insights into substance-impaired driving patterns that contribute significantly to road trauma.
•	Focused on the BITRE Drug Tests enforcement dashboard as the core of our project.
•	Road safety enforcement is critical as drug-impaired driving remains a leading contributor to serious road injuries and fatalities in Australia. According to BITRE reports, substance-impaired drivers are significantly overrepresented in fatal crashes.
•	Our target audience includes transport safety policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and public health officials who require accessible data to inform evidence-based interventions.
•	The existing BITRE dashboard lacks several key limitations:
o	Limited interactivity prevents users from filtering data by specific demographics or time periods
o	Does not visualize detailed demographic breakdowns (age groups, detection methods)
o	Difficult for users to identify trends or make jurisdictional comparisons easily
o	Lacks correlation analysis between different drug types
o	Minimal visual representation of enforcement outcomes (fines, arrests, charges)

Figure 1: BITRE Drug Tests Dashboard (Reference)
•	Our visualization will enable users to perform these key activities:
o	Compare drug test rates and enforcement outcomes across Australian jurisdictions
o	Analyze trends in drug type prevalence over time (2008-2024)
o	View offense rates segmented by age demographics
o	Identify correlations between different drug types in positive tests
o	Assess the relationship between positive drug tests and enforcement actions

1.2 Visualisation Purpose
•	This visualization aims to transform complex drug driving enforcement data into accessible, interactive insights that support informed decision-making and public awareness.
•	The five research questions guiding our visualization design:
o	Age Patterns: How do drug test rates vary across age groups, and which drugs are most prevalent in each age demographic?
o	Geographic Trends: How have drug test rates evolved over time across Australian jurisdictions, and are there regional patterns in drug type prevalence?
o	Drug Correlations: What correlations exist between different drug types in positive tests, and how do these patterns vary by age and location?
o	Enforcement Analysis: What's the relationship between positive drug tests and enforcement outcomes (fines, arrests, charges), and how do these vary by drug type and jurisdiction?
o	Detection Impact: How do different detection methods affect accuracy and outcomes of drug testing, and what are the implications for understanding true drug usage patterns?

•	Benefits of the completed visualization:
o	Helps policymakers identify high-risk demographics and regions requiring targeted enforcement
o	Increases public transparency on enforcement trends and effectiveness
o	Enables law enforcement agencies to optimize resource allocation based on data-driven insights
o	Encourages safer driving behaviour through increased awareness of testing prevalence
o	Supports researchers in identifying patterns that may inform future road safety interventions


2 Data
2.1 DATA SOURCE AND GOVERNANCE
•	Original data source: Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) National Road Safety Data Hub
