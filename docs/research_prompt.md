# Deep Research Prompt: Australian Roadside Drug Testing Context

**Role:** Act as a senior transport safety researcher.

**Task:** Conduct a deep literature review on **Roadside Drug Testing (RDT) enforcement in Australia** from 2016 to present.

**Objective:** Find **5-7 high-quality academic sources** (peer-reviewed journals or government reports like BITRE/CARRS-Q) that address the following specific themes to support a Data Visualisation Design Book.

## Specific Themes to Research

1.  **Crash Risk Correlation:**
    *   Find studies that quantify the actual crash risk increase associated with **Methylamphetamine** and **Cannabis** presence in drivers.
    *   *Key Question:* Does the "presence" of these drugs directly correlate to a quantified increase in crash risk?

2.  **Deterrence vs. Detection:**
    *   Find research analyzing whether increasing the *volume* of tests (RDT) actually reduces road trauma, or if it primarily just increases detection statistics.
    *   *Key Question:* Is RDT functioning as an effective general deterrent?

3.  **Impairment vs. Presence:**
    *   Find critical papers discussing the limitation of current oral fluid tests (which test for presence, not necessarily impairment).
    *   *Context:* Look for discussions regarding medicinal cannabis laws in Victoria or NSW and the challenge of "unimpaired" positive tests.

## Required Output Format

For each source, provide:

*   **Citation:** Full APA7 format.
*   **Key Finding:** A 2-sentence summary of what the paper proved (e.g., "Found that meth increases crash odds by 6x, while cannabis was 1.3x").
*   **Relevance:** A brief note on how this supports a data visualization about "drug types" or "jurisdictional trends."
