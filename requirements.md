# Assignment: Data Visualisation Project Design Book and Website (team)
**Course:** COS30045 Data Visualisation
**Due Date:** 12 Dec at 23:59
**Weight:** 45% of final mark
**Points:** 56

---

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose
The goal is to demonstrate that the team can develop an interactive data visualisation that meets user needs. The submission is split into two main components:
1.  **Design Book:** Evidence of data processing and the design process.
2.  **Website:** Hosted website containing the interactive data visualisation.

**Note:** The project must satisfy the brief provided in the "Project Topic and Data Set" (external course link).

## 2. Submission Deliverables
You must submit the following files and links. **Resubmission is NOT permitted.**

### A. Files to Upload
* **File 1: Design Book**
    * **Format:** PDF
    * **Content:** Written assignment based on the provided template.
* **File 2: Data Processing**
    * **Format:** KNWF (KNIME file)
    * **Naming:** File name must include the **team name**.
    * **Content:** The file must include the data.

### B. Links (Required in Submission Comments)
You must post the following links in the **comment section** of the submission:
1.  Link to the website hosted on **Vercel** (charts must be programmed in D3).
2.  Link to the project **GitHub** site.

## 3. Teamwork & Individual Contribution
* **Team Formation:** Teams are formed in Week 7.
* **Forced Individual Work:** Students will be required to work alone if they:
    * Have not tried to join a team before Week 9.
    * Have not meaningfully communicated with their team before Week 9 Class.
    * Have not contributed to teamwork before Week 10 Stand-up.
* **Peer Evaluation:** Students rated poorly by teammates or identified as non-participants may have their marks reduced relative to the achieved project mark.

## 4. Academic Integrity & Stand-ups
* **Stand-Ups:** You must submit work in progress for each Stand-up.
    * Submit expected milestones.
    * Demonstrate understanding of the work submitted.
* **Penalties:**
    * Achieving two or more fail marks on Stand-ups may result in a mark reduction.
    * Lack of continuity between the final project and Stand-up submissions may trigger an integrity investigation.

## 5. Grading Rubric (56 Points Total)

| Criteria | Points | Requirements for High Distinction (HD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction and Purpose** | 4 pts | Clearly defines audience, motivation, and purpose. Identifies key user tasks and benefits. Well-structured, insightful, and uses academic research for context. |
| **Data Processing and Governance** | 5 pts | Thoroughly explains data sources, governance, quality, and preprocessing steps. Includes well-documented KNIME workflows. |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis** | 4 pts | Effectively explores the dataset using appropriate techniques. Clear insights derived from summary statistics and charts. |
| **Visualisation & Webpage Design** | 10 pts | Well-justified selection of chart types adhering to design principles. Effective use of colour, labels, annotations, wireframes, and storyboards. |
| **Interactivity (Design)** | 4 pts | Interactive features significantly enhance usability. Justified interactions improve data exploration and/or understanding. |
| **Iteration & Validation** | 5 pts | Shows iterative testing, feedback implementation, and usability evaluation with clear improvements. Accessibility features are discussed and fully implemented. |
| **Implementation 1: Coding Practice** | 5 pts | Code is well-structured, efficient, modular, and well-commented. The site loads quickly and handles large datasets efficiently. |
| **Implementation 2: Complexity** | 5 pts | Implements advanced, non-standard visualisations and thoughtfully applied annotations. Successfully integrates multiple datasets (joins, transformations, filtering) to enhance depth of insights. |
| **Implementation 3: Interactivity** | 5 pts | A variety of interactive features are implemented well, allowing deep data exploration. Interactions are smooth and responsive. |
| **Implementation 4: Storytelling** | 5 pts | Tells a compelling, data-driven story. Context, insights, and conclusions are clearly communicated, guiding the user effectively. |
| **Referencing** | 2 pts | All references are accurate and consistently formatted (APA7). Wide range of high-quality sources seamlessly integrated. |
| **AI Declaration** | 2 pts | Clearly discloses use of AI tools, specifying the extent of assistance and how AI content was incorporated while maintaining integrity. |
